# Introduction
Docker makes it easier, simpler and safer to build, deploy and manage applications in a docker container.
This article will help you get a detailed understanding of;
* What is docker?
* Why use Docker?
* What is a docker image?
* What is a docker container?
* Dockerizing a flask application

###### What is Docker?
Docker is an open source containerization platform for developing, shipping and running applications.

Docker packages software into standardized units called containers. Containers have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

[More about what docker is](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

###### Why use Docker?

* Responsive deployment and scaling.
* Faster And Consistent Delivery Of Applications.
* 

###### Docker image.
Image is a read-only template with instruction for creating containers.
Docker images can be considered as the blueprint of the entire application environment that you create. 

###### Docker container.
* A Docker container is a virtualized run-time environment where users can isolate applications from the underlying system.
* Containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an application quickly and easily.
* Docker containers contains all the essential things required to run an application like code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. 

###### Dockerizing a flask application

###### File structure and setup
```
\-- dockerExample
    |-- app.py
    |-- Dockerfile
    |-- requirements.txt
   \-- templates
        |-- index.html
        
```
        
First I created a simple Flask application and added the following code to app.py.

```python
from flask import Flask,render_template
app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__==('__main__'):
    app.run(debug=True)
```
[Check how to create a simple flask application](https://dev.to/phylis/my-first-flask-application-2mm)

Add the following code to index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Getting started with Docker</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is my Dockerfile</p>

</body>
```

Now we need to dockerize the flask application by creating a **Dockerfile**
**Dockerfile**is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Add the following code to docker;

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9.6
COPY . /doc
COPY ./requirements.txt /doc/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /doc
EXPOSE 5000:5000
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

* **FROM** keyword is used to specify the base image to be used. We'll be making use of a python base image.
* **WORKDIR** defines the main directory of operations.
* **EXPOSE** informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 
* **RUN**  is used to install the projectâ€™s dependencies.
* **CMD** provide defaults for an executing container.

We can now build our image with the **docker build** command as shown below;

```
docker image build -t docker_example .
```

Once the build process is done, we can run the application with the docker run command as shown below;
```
docker run -p 5000:5000 docker_example
```
